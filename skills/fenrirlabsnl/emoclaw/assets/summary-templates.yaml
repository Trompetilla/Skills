# summary-templates.yaml — Generic summary template for the emotion skill
#
# Each template has:
#   tags: list of emotion tags to match (e.g. "valence_high", "arousal_low")
#   phrases: list of phrases to choose from (picked randomly)
#
# Tags are generated from the emotion vector:
#   "{dim}_high" when value > 0.65
#   "{dim}_low"  when value < 0.35
#
# Templates are matched by finding the entry with the most overlapping tags.
# The empty-tags entry [] is the fallback when nothing else matches.
